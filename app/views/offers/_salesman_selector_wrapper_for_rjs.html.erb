<%#
  The salesman selector is part of the offer form and thus relies on its
  form builder.

  We are now in a flow of execution where no form builder is in context, so we
  construct a dummy one just to fool the partial. This wrapper is dirty I must
  admit, but the overall setup I think is quite DRY.

  <%= render :partial => 'offers/salesman_selector', :locals => {:form => form} %>
